Tabsplit
========

Splits a tab based on an easily readable input file.

Usage: `./preprocessor.py < sampleinput.tab`

## TODO

- Better input format: names start with a capital letter
  - The first name is the payer
  - The remaining names are the leechers
  - Amount is the first number after the payer
